# Cloudflare Minecraft Avatar API

I used Cloudflare Workers, Hono, and Photon to quickly put together a API to crop skin and cape textures.

Pretty easy to run yourself.

I am also hosting it on my own Cloudflare https://cf-minecraft-avatar-api.faav.workers.dev/ (You can see the documentation here)
